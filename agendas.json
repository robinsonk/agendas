      "description": "<p>The weekly Vertical LifePlanner Binder is a classic agenda with a twist - it features vertically stacked daily columns that you can use to break up your days however you choose and comes in a ring binder.</p><p>This best-selling layout includes yearly overviews, monthly spreads, and (of course) the unique Monday-start weekly pages.</p><p>While the LifePlanner Binder doesn’t have as wide a range of designs or customization options, the ability to add initials in gold, silver, or rose gold foil is still there.</p>",
      "pros": ["The sturdy ring binder design means that your pages stay safe and well-protected inside your bag", "LifePlanners contain 80lb Mohawk paper, which is soft, thick, and can handle a variety of pens and markers", "Tons of accessories available for purchase that go with the planner, plus even more made by small planner businesses"],
      "cons": ["The binder design utilizes a unique hole-punch style, so you will need to purchase a compatible hole-punch to add pages", "Erin Condren planners typically run on the pricier side, with the LifePlanner Binder starting at $55 before any customization", "The same in-planner extras that come with the coilbound LifePlanner come with the ring binder version as well, but are not hole-punched to fit inside the binder"],
      "goodToKnow": ["If you love the Erin Condren look and brand, but aren’t crazy about the binder format, you can opt for a coilbound weekly <a href=’/planners/erin-condren-lifeplanner-vertical’>vertical</a>, <a href=’/planners/erin-condren-lifeplanner-hourly’>hourly</a>, or <a href=’/planners/erin-condren-lifeplanner-horizontal>horizontal</a> layout instead.", "If you want to skip customization and get a planner quickly, you can often find Erin Condren planners and accessories on Amazon Prime.", "As mentioned in the ‘cons’ section above, the included sticker sheets and extra folder are coil-punched to fit inside a coiled planner, but not hole-punched to fit inside the ring binder. That means, in order to keep all your goodies together, you’ll have to purchase the specific hole punch for this planner, which is disappointing for a company known for its high-quality planners and extras."],
      "bottomLine": "The LifePlanner Binder is an excellent choice for those who love the size and layouts of Erin Condren planners and want the ability to add/remove pages at will. With the ring binder design, you can simply purchase packs of pages to refill it, as well as many custom pages/planners made by small businesses (as long as you purchase the special hole-punch required).",
